# Python-Reminders
This is a simple python set of python scripts which lets you remind yourself of appointments and assignments. I use it with the windows task manager.

The project uses tkinter for the GUI. On my computer, it runs every two hours, asking me if I need to remind myself of anything. It 
will then also show me my upcoming reminders.
